VisioGraphic RESUME

ABSTRACT:
Each and every person needs a resume at least once in a lifetime, it may be for the job interview or to show what that person knows. Normally Resume are strictly written, they don’t have any decorations or colors to it. But even people need to change as the time changes, we need to get accustomed to the modern technological methods. One of the latest technology that has revolutionised the market is the concept of “Data Visualization”. So why don’t we add this concept of Data Visualization to a small thing called Resume? The idea behind this is, we use only text to fill out our resume’s. Instead of text why don’t we fill the resume’s with representation of data. As we know “A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words”, in the same way visualizing data is worth a million words of pure text.


PROPOSED METHOD:
* We are going to use a timeline graph in order to represent various things like Education, Employment, Achievements & Future Goal.
* We are going to provide various attributes like Contact Information, Professional Area, Status, Salary, Position, Education Level, Job Type & Mobility in an interactive way.
* We display the User Interest’s, Identity, Hobbies & languages in an data visualization point of prospective with user interactions.
* We even represent the kinds of fields like “I WANT TO WORK WHERE” and “MY SKILL CHARACTERISTICS” according user’s mind set.
* We represent the skill set of the user in the following format:
    * Years of Experience.
    * Collaborative design for a topic, for ex: “GUI” CSS, JS, AJAX & etc.
    * Nested elements for the topic.
    
    
DATA:
When we visit the website, at first the website will be like a template with pre populated sample fields. The user can then fill his fields on his own. In our project the data is taken from the user as an input & the program we design takes that input and represents that data in a graphical way.


GRAPHIC TYPE:
* Timeline GraphEducation/ Work/ Achievements/ Goal.
* Donut ChartUser’s SkillSet.
* Vertical Pointer MappingPersonal Identity
* Horizontal Pointer Mapping“ I want to work where” & “My Skill Characteristics”


INTERACTIONS:
* The user gets a left sidebar, when he hover on it he will get all of his details like Contact Information, Professional Area, Status, Salary, Position, Education Level, Job Type & Mobility
* The timeline is the heart of this project, the timeline gives the user interactivity like setting his years of study by dragging the pointer & even getting the information related to it by hovering the timeline.
* The skill set area gives the user to modify its fields & manually drag the pointer to set the donut chart.
* The personal Identity section which uses “Vertical Pointer Mapping” gives the user to keep the users desired position in place of a pointer & the same thing goes for “Horizontal Pointer Mapping”
